## [0.1.1] - 2025-05-07

### Added
- MANIFEST.in to include LICENSE, NOTICE, and key source files in the source distribution (sdist).
- Validation steps in the CI workflow to check .whl and .tar.gz artifacts using zipfile, file, and sha256sum before upload.
- CI logic for verifying the presence of all distribution files prior to publishing.

### Changed
GitHub Actions CI workflow to use merge-multiple: true for consolidating build artifacts.

### Fixed
- ImportError caused by mismatched Rust module export function (PyInit_werx_rust missing).
- Publishing issues caused by file reuse and broken wheels due to structure mismatches.

### Removed
- Platform suffixes from wheel filenames to ensure compatibility with PyPIâ€™s strict filename parsing and attestation requirements.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-05-05

### Added
- Project scaffolding, maturin integration, and core Python/Rust interface.
- Initial public release of **WERx**: a high-performance Word Error Rate library.
- Pure-Rust backed corpus-level WER computation via PyO3.
- Python wrapper ('wer.py') supporting string and list input formats.
- Benchmarks comparing speed and memory against other python packages.
- Memory benchmark script using 'memory-profiler' with relative usage summary.
- Performance benchmark script using 'time' and 'timeit', including relative speed ratio outputs.
- Test suite using 'pytest', with coverage of valid, blank, and invalid input cases.
- Linting configuration with 'ruff'; type checking setup with 'mypy'.
- Type annotations for the 'wer()' Python API wrapper, improving type checking with 'mypy'.
- Optional dependency groups for 'dev' and 'benchmarks' in 'pyproject.toml'.
- Updated 'README.md' with project description, installation and usage examples.
- 'CHANGELOG.md' formatted to support automation via CI release tooling.
- Introduced a parallel GitHub Actions workflow to validate wheel and sdist builds across Linux, Windows, and macOS without uploading to PyPI. This mirrors the logic and structure of ci.yml, excluding trusted publishing. Useful for testing build artifacts prior to official release.
